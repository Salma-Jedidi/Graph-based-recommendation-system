This helps in reducing the size of our vocabulary. Unlike stemming, lemmatization reduces words to their base word ensuring that the root word belongs to the language. It’s usually more sophisticated than stemming, since stemmers works on an individual word without knowledge of the context. In the other side lemmatizers uses the linguistic knowledge and the context to derive a properly spelled and grammatically correct base form.<br>\n","Just like for stemming, there are different lemmatizers. For this example, we’ll use WordNet lemmatizer.<br>\n","Note that POS tagging can improve lemmatization accuracy. For example, the word ‘leaves’ without a POS tag would get lemmatized to the word ‘leaf’, but with a verb tag, its lemma would become ‘leave’.
